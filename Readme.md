## 🎯 Overview

AgriSentinel empowers farmers with enterprise-grade satellite monitoring technology that was previously accessible only to large agricultural corporations. By leveraging Google Earth Engine's Sentinel-2 satellite data and unsupervised machine learning, we provide real-time crop health insights through an intuitive web interface.

### Key Features

- 🛰️ **Real-Time Satellite Analysis** - Access to 10m resolution Sentinel-2 imagery via Google Earth Engine
- 🤖 **AI Anomaly Detection** - Isolation Forest ML model trained on 5 years of historical NDVI/EVI data
- 📱 **Mobile-First Design** - GPS-enabled corner recording for field boundary capture
- 🗺️ **Interactive Heatmaps** - Visual crop health zones with severity indicators
- 📊 **Advanced Analytics** - NDVI, EVI scores, temporal trends, and alert system
- 📅 **Historical Comparison** - Analyze any past date against seasonal patterns
- 🌐 **Offline-Capable** - Polygon drawing works without constant internet
